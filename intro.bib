	abstract="Software agents offer a range of benefits to the development of complex software systems. However, before these benefits can be realised by the computing industry there is a need for an agent platform that can be accepted by industry. In this paper we describe the JACK agent platform: a mature and robust commercial product. We argue that JACK meets requirements such as familiarity, scalability and integratibility which make it suitable for adoption by industry. We also describe interesting features of JACK such as the use of capabilities for structuring agents, and JACK's approach to teamwork which allows hierarchical team structures.",

	abstract="Within the ATAL community, the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model has come to be possibly the best known and best studied model of practical reasoning agents. There are several reasons for its success, but perhaps the most compelling are that the BDI model combines a respectable philosophical model of human practical reasoning, (originally developed by Michael Bratman [1]), a number of implementations (in the IRMA architecture [2] and the various PRS-like systems currently available [7]), several successful applications (including the now-famous fault diagnosis system for the space shuttle, as well as factory process control systems and business process management [8]), and finally, an elegant abstract logical semantics, which have been taken up and elaborated upon widely within the agent research community [14, 16].",

	abstract="This paper presents a study of the dynamic coupling between a user and a virtual character during body interaction. Coupling is directly linked with other dimensions, such as co-presence, engagement, and believability, and was measured in an experiment that allowed users to describe their subjective feelings about those dimensions of interest. The experiment was based on a theatrical game involving the imitation of slow upper-body movements and the proposal of new movements by the user and virtual agent. The agent's behaviour varied in autonomy: the agent could limit itself to imitating the user's movements only, initiate new movements, or combine both behaviours. After the game, each participant completed a questionnaire regarding their engagement in the interaction, their subjective feeling about the co-presence of the agent, etc. Based on four main dimensions of interest, we tested several hypotheses against our experimental results, which are discussed here.",

	abstract="FlurMax, a virtual agent, inhabits a hallway at the University of Bielefeld. He resides in a wide-screen panel equipped with a video camera to track and interact with visitors using speech, gesture, and emotional facial expression. For example, FlurMax will detect the presence of visitors and greet them with a friendly wave, saying ''Hello, I am Max''. FlurMax also recognizes simple gesturing of the by-passer, such as waving, and produces natural multimodal behaviors in response. FlurMax's behavior selection is controlled by a simple emotional/motivational system which gradually changes his mood between states like happy, bored, surprised, and neutral.",

	abstract="User interaction with virtual agents generally takes place in virtual environments in which there is clear separation between the virtual actors and the user, due to the fact that in most cases, the user is in some way external to the virtual world. In Mixed-Reality Interactive Storytelling, the user's video image is captured in real time and inserted into a virtual world populated by autonomous synthetic actors with which the user interacts. The user in turn watches the composite world projected on a large screen, following a ''magic mirror'' metaphor. This context leads to re-investigating the techniques by which the user interacts with virtual actors, as well as exploring specific research problems. In this paper, we discuss some specificities of user interaction with virtual actors in Mixed Reality Interactive Storytelling. After a brief introduction to our system's architecture and the example scenario supporting our experiments, we describe various techniques supporting multi-modal interaction with virtual actors.",

	abstract="Interactive Narrative is an approach to interactive entertainment that enables the player to make decisions that directly affect the direction and/or outcome of the narrative experience being delivered by the computer system. Interactive narrative requires two seemingly conflicting requirements: coherent narrative and user agency. We present an interactive narrative system that uses a combination of narrative control and autonomous believable character agents to augment a story world simulation in which the user has a high degree of agency with narrative plot control. A drama manager called the Automated Story Director gives plot-based guidance to believable agents. The believable agents are endowed with the autonomy necessary to carry out directives in the most believable fashion possible. Agents also handle interaction with the user. When the user performs actions that change the world in such a way that the Automated Story Director can no longer drive the intended narrative forward, it is able to adapt the plot to incorporate the user's changes and still achieve dramatic goals.",

	abstract="Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents have been investigated by many researchers from both a theoretical specification perspective and a practical design perspective. However, there still remains a large gap between theory and practice. The main reason for this has been the complexity of theorem-proving or model-checking in these expressive specification logics. Hence, the implemented BDI systems have tended to use the three major attitudes as data structures, rather than as modal operators. In this paper, we provide an alternative formalization of BDI agents by providing an operational and proof-theoretic semantics of a language AgentSpeak(L). This language can be viewed as an abstraction of one of the implemented BDI systems (i.e., PRS) and allows agent programs to be written and interpreted in a manner similar to that of horn-clause logic programs. We show how to perform derivations in this logic using a simple example. These derivations can then be used to prove the properties satisfied by BDI agents.",
